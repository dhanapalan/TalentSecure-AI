## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# If port 5173 (client) is in use:
cd client && npm run dev -- --port 5174

# If port 5000 (server) is in use:
cd server && npm run dev -- --port 5001
```

### Database Connection Error
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose logs postgres

# If not, start it:
docker-compose up postgres -d

# Run migrations again:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Missing Test Data
```bash
# Seed the database
npx prisma db seed
```

### Clear Everything & Start Fresh
```bash
# Stop all containers
docker-compose down -v

# Remove node_modules and lock files (if needed)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Fresh start
docker-compose up -d
npm install
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run dev
```
